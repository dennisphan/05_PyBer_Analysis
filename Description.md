# PyBer_Analysis

You've just received the work assignment of a lifetime: creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. As a new employee, this is a huge professional opportunity for you!

The first step is to make sure you have the right tools in place. A simple Excel chart isn't going to impress V. Isualize. Instead, you'll use the Python graphing library Matplotlib, which is a favorite tool among data scientists and data analysts because of its robust visualization features.

Omar has given you some backstory about the connection between V. Isualize and Matplotlib. Matplotlib was created as a Python alternative for MATLAB. MATLAB, which is short for matrix laboratory, was developed by the company MathWorks in the 1980s. It enabled scientists to perform linear algebra and numerical analysis without learning the programming language Fortran, which until then had been the best option for complex computations.

With this information, you realize that the CEO is an expert in creating data visualizations. You definitely can't afford to botch this up!

 - Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
 - Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
     - The total number of rides for each city type.
     - The average fares for each city type.
     - The total number of drivers for each city type.
 - Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
     - The number of rides for each city type.
     - The fares for each city type.
     - The number of drivers for each city type.
 - Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
     - The percent of total fares.
     - The percent of total rides.
     - The percent of total drivers.
